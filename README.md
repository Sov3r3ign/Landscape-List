# Landscape List
Android Studio: An android list of landscapes. With the use of Arrays
<p>A ListActivity class is needed to display a list of items. It's part of the Android SDK and
provides built-in functionality to display data in a list view.</p> <p>In essence, ListActivity is a
subclass of Activity that automatically provides a ListView (a type of view that displays a list
of items). You can use ListActivity along with ListView to create apps that require displaying
lists of data, such as contacts, products, or other types of information.</p>
<p>An <b>array adapter</b> supplies the array data to the ListView</p>
<p>The <b>setListAdapter</b> connects the list items to the images or Web pages they represent</p>
Android intents send and receive activities and services.
