# Landscape List
Android Studio: An android list of landscapes. With the use of Arrays
A ListActivity class is needed to display a list of items. It's part of the Android SDK and
provides built-in functionality to display data in a list view. In essence, ListActivity is a
subclass of Activity that automatically provides a ListView (a type of view that displays a list
of items). You can use ListActivity along with ListView to create apps that require displaying
lists of data, such as contacts, products, or other types of information.
An array adapter supplies the array data to the ListView
The setListAdapter connects the list items to the images or Web pages they represent
Android intents send and receive activities and services.
